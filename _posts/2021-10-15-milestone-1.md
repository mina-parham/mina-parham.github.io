## Presented by [this notebook](https://github.com/Jawing/ift6758-project-template-main/blob/main/milestone1.ipynb)

## Data acquisition

To analyse the NHL play-by-play data, we have acquired its games from season 2016-2017 to 2020-2021.

Our data acquisition came from the *play-by-play* API described [here](https://gitlab.com/dword4/nhlapi/-/blob/master/stats-api.md#game-ids).
Each game's info can be accessed by it's 8-digit `GAME_ID` using RESTapi from the endpoint "https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/GAME_ID/feed/live/". Example: [Game ID 2016020001](https://statsapi.web.nhl.com/api/v1/game/2016020001/feed/live/).

<!-- 
The first 4 digits identify the season of the game (ie. 2017 for the 2017-2018 season). The next 2 digits give the type of game, where 01 = preseason, 02 = regular season, 03 = playoffs, 04 = all-star. The final 4 digits identify the specific game number. For regular season and preseason games, this ranges from 0001 to the number of games played. (1271 for seasons with 31 teams (2017 and onwards) and 1230 for seasons with 30 teams). For playoff games, the 2nd digit of the specific number gives the round of the playoffs, the 3rd digit specifies the matchup, and the 4th digit specifies the game (out of 7). -->

### Code Tutorial

With the code shown [here](https://github.com/Jawing/ift6758-project-template-main/blob/db17c049c18780093df42429a4862af93995522a/ift6758/data/functions.py#L71), the data can be acquired by specifying the year and the location stored. Eg. `dfs = loadstats(2019,'./data')`
It will be stored in the a pandas dataframe explained by the docstrings.

<!-- Write a brief tutorial on how your team downloaded the dataset. Imagine :) that you were searching for a guide on how to download the play-by-play data; your guide should make you go “Perfect - this is exactly what I was looking for!”. This can be as simple as copying in your function and an example usage, and writing one or two sentences describing it. -->

### Interactive Debugging Tool

Using [ipywidgets](https://ipywidgets.readthedocs.io/en/latest/) we have created an interactive tool shown below.

![image](/assets/images/milestone1/q3.jpg)

The widget displays the visualization of a play event on the rink, and also displays the relevant play information. We can choose any play event in any game given a season dataframe taken from the [data acquisition function](##data-acquisition). An option to choose if a game is in a regular season or playoffs is also included.

## Tidy Data

We have formatted the acquired data in a way that makes it easier for us to analyse the shots/goals across the season. The function can be found [here](https://github.com/Jawing/ift6758-project-template-main/blob/main/ift6758/data/tidyData.py)

### A snippet of the dataframe

## Simple Visualizations

### A bar chart of shot types over all teams

<img src="/assets/images/milestone1/q5_1.png" alt="">

We can tell visually that the most **dangerous** type of shot is *tip in* because it has the highest percentage of goal. The *snap shot* is also notably dangerous since the percentage is close to tip in.The most **common** type of shot is *wrist shot* because this shot type has attempted more than any shot type in the dataset.

### Shottype vs Distance Heatmap

<img src="/assets/images/milestone1/q5_3_heatmap.png" width="90%" height="90%" alt="">

The heatmap shows the goal percentage as a function of **both** distance and shot types. On the horizontal axis, a distance category of [0, 10] means the shot distance (Euclidean distance between shot and net) is between 0-10 feet. The value in each box indicates the chance of scoring with this particular shot type and distance.  

The most dangerous type of shots is **slap shot** taken within **10-20 feet** of the net - it has a 29% chance of scoring. The least dangerous types of shot when taken closed to the net (less than 20 feet) is the *wrap-around*.  

Another interesting thing is that while most of the shot types have around 20% of scoring chances, the chances drop by a large amount when the distance is between 10-20 feet. We can see this by comparing the first and second column. The implication is that for teams who take primarily in the 10-20 feet area, they might have an incentive to try to place primarily slap shots and snap shots rather than the other kind of shots.

## Advanced Visualizations

Below is a **rotated** (counter-clockwise) hockey rink map. The x-axis represents the width of the arena, and y-axis is a half length of the arena. In each region, *white* means the **number of shots** placed in this area is **comparable** to the league average. *Red* indicates a **higher** than average number of shots, while *blue* indicates **less**. The intensity of color indicates **how strong the deviation from average** is.

### A few examples from Colorado Avalanche

<img src="/assets/images/milestone1/colorado_avalanche_2016.png" alt="">

In 2016, the shot frequency from Colorado is **less or equal to league average** (suggested by the blue and white color area) on almost every area of the arena, except on the left side area where it is 60 feet away from the net. In particular, they **take far less shots in the area that is 0-30 feet away from the net**, suggesting they has a hard time placing shots in the most threatening area.

<img src="/assets/images/milestone1/colorado_avalanche_2020.png" alt="">

In 2020, the shot frequency from Colorado is **higher than league average** on most of the areas (suggested by the red color area), especially on the left side. In particular, they **take far more shots in the area that is 0-30 feet away from the net**, suggesting they has a much easier time placing shots in the most threatening area.

This suggests they are now a leading team in the league. The team ranking confirms our impression: Colorado was ranked last in their division in 2016, with 22 win out of 82 games; they ranked first in 2020-2021 season, winning 39 out of 56 games.

### A few examples from Tampa Bay Lighting and Buffalo Sabres

<img src="/assets/images/milestone1/tampa_2018.png" alt="">
<img src="/assets/images/milestone1/buffalo_2018.png" alt="">

Tampa Bay has **far more shots than league average** in the center area, especially at the area 0-30 feet away from the net, where threat of shots is highest. Sabres on the other hand has **less** shots than league average, except at some peripheral areas. This suggests that Lightning’s is more successful at organizing attacks, and only place shots where it has a relatively high scoring chance (i.e. close to the net). In contrast, Sabres seems not able to shoot in close range where the threat would be the highest. Their **above average shooting in the peripheral area** suggests that they are forced to released shots in unfavorable places.

<img src="/assets/images/milestone1/tampa_2019.png" alt="">
<img src="/assets/images/milestone1/buffalo_2019.png" alt="">

Lightning’s has made **significant improvement** over season 2018: their average shots is higher than league average almost everywhere. They also have far more shots in the 80-90 feet area compared to 2018, which was their weakest area. The Sabres' **maintains the same kind of performance**, struggling to get shots in the 0-40 feet away from net area that is right in front of the net, meaning their shots are most likely to be **lower quality shots**.

<img src="/assets/images/milestone1/tampa_2020.png" alt="">
<img src="/assets/images/milestone1/buffalo_2020.png" alt="">

If we look at the the **y-axis**, the excess shots vs Avg is **significantly higher** for Lightning’s compared to previous season. They continue to dominate most of the area, meaning that not only do they have more shots, most of the shots were placed right in front of the net as well. The Sabres’ shots however, has a similar to pattern to the previous years. They have not improved.

In conclusion, Lightning’s has a shot pattern that excels in **quality (the area of the shot)** and in **quantity (the overwhelming red area)**, and they have **improved every season** (the y-axis has to be adjusted). Sabres has **lower quantity** of shots (the blue area) and in particular, the **shot quality is very low** (the dark blue area in front of the net).
