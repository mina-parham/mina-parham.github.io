**Explaining the behavior of reinforcement learning agents using association rules** \| Fall 2022 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/explainable_rl.pdf)

\- Deep reinforcement learning algorithms are increasingly used to drive decision-making systems. However, there exists a known tension between the efficiency of a machine learning algorithm and its level of explainability.
Generally speaking, increased efficiency comes with the cost of decisions that are harder to explain. This concern is related to explainable artificial intelligence, which is a hot topic in the research community.
In this paper, we propose to explain the behaviour of a deep reinforcement learning algorithm thanks to standard data mining tools, i.e. association rules. We apply this idea to the design of playing bots, which is ubiquitous in the video game industry. To do so, we designed three agents trained with a deep Q-learning algorithm for the game Street FighterTurbo II. Each agent has a specific playing style. Our experiments show that association rules can provide interesting insights on the behavior of each agent, and reflect their specific playing style. We believe that this work is a next step towards the explanation of complex models in deep reinforcement learning.

<!-- **Convolution vs Attention \| University of Montreal** \| Winter 2022 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/Conv_vs_Attention.pdf)  
\- Comparatively analyzed vision models (ResNet, ViT, ConvNext) based on convolution or attention architectures using a proxy shape-bias metric on out-of-domain Stylized Imagenet samples to measure generalization performance; with visualization shown [here](./assets/images/shape-bias.html).  
\- Developed a framework to evaluate the out-of-domain trained models vs in-domain trained models on external medical image classification tasks. -->

**Hockey Goal Prediction \| University of Montreal** \| Fall 2022 [<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i>](./_posts/2021-11-30-milestone-2.md)  
\- We analyzed hockey data, specifically the NHL stats API, in order to retrieve data for a specific period of time using REST API concepts.\
\- We have formatted the acquired data in a way that makes it easier to analyze the games.\
\- We created interactive and representative plots using matplotlib, Seaborn, and ploty to analyze and gain insights into the games and communicate the results more effectively.\
\- Selecting and creating features for downstream models, encoding features that cannot be directly used in ML models, and creating a good xG classifier.
\- We tracked our experiments using Comet.ml.\
\- A model service flask app has been built using all the models that were trained and saved into Comet ML and deployed into a Docker container.\
\- In addition, we built a "Live game client" that retrieved shot events from live (or historical) NHL games, preprocessed them into features compatible with our model, and then queried our model service for expected goal predictions. \
\- After that, Streamlit will be used to package the live game client into an interactive dashboard.\
\- You can view the deployed final project [here](http://139.177.198.52:5005/). You can select the model and version, as well as the game ID to get the prediction.\
