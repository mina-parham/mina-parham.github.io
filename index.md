<!-- ## About me -->

Faithful to people and technology, striving to achieve personal and educational goals. I'm always enthusiastic about learning new skills while sharing intriguing ideas in life.

Currently a Prof. MSc student in Machine Learning at [Mila](https://mila.quebec/). My academic interest is focused on Meta-Learning and Continual Learning. Applications in academia, mental health and neuroscience are my biggest motivators when it comes to [Deep Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deep_learning).

## Projects & Experiences

<!-- **Machine Learning Engineer \| Humanware** \| 2022  
\- Worked in teams to develop computer vision object detection models for visually impaired people.  
\- notes
-->

**Convolution vs Attention \| University of Montreal** \| Winter 2022 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/Conv_vs_Attention.pdf)  
\- Comparatively analyzed vision models (ResNet, ViT, ConvNext) based on convolution or attention architectures using a proxy shape-bias metric on out-of-domain Stylized Imagenet samples to measure generalization performance; with visualization shown [here](./assets/images/shape-bias.html).  
\- Developed a framework to evaluate the out-of-domain trained models vs in-domain trained models on external medical image classification tasks.

**Hockey Goal Prediction \| University of Montreal** \| Fall 2021 [<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i>](./_posts/2021-11-30-milestone-2.md)  
\- Performed exploratory data analysis on NHL play-by-play data by building an interactive 2D shot-heatmap using plotly and ipywidget.  
\- Developed a goal prediction service on flask with docker using the top-performing ensemble models (XGboost) based on their ROC-AUC in comet.ml.

**Navigaze \| McGill Code Jam** \| 2019 [<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i>](https://devpost.com/software/navigreat-hviz0n)  
\- Designed a browser extension that generates a table-of-contents from any webpage, text selection using keywords, key sentences for text summarization.  
\- Developed the backend extractive text summarization model using TextRank algorithm with spaCy and Flask.

**Toxicity Detection \| McGill** \| 2019 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/Toxicity_Detection.pdf)  
\- Compared performances across different models such as CNN, LSTM and lexical using ROC-AUC metrics for detecting toxicity while maximizing group fairness across different identity subgroups.  
\- Worked with pre-trained transformer models (BERT, GPT) and word embeddings such as word2vec, GloVe.

**SqueezeNet Reproducibility \| McGill** \| 2019 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/Squeezenet_Reproducibility.pdf)  
\- Analysis of SqueezeNet architecture vs AlexNet on CIFAR-10 by ablation while maintaining the model size reduction intended in SqueezeNet.

**Modified MNist Classification \| McGill** \| 2019 [<i class="fa-solid fa-file"></i>](./papers/Modified_Mnist_Classifier.pdf)  
\- Incrementally tested hyperparameters such as loss functions, optimizers, normalization, dropouts, preprocessing and augmentations (OpenCV) for image classification.  
\- Worked with state-of-the-art CNN models (Resnet, EfficientNet) and developed ensembles to further increase classification accuracies.

**Irrelevant.ai \| McGill ImplementAI** \| 2019 [<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i>](https://devpost.com/software/irrelevant-ai)  
\- Designed a movie recommendation system with a two-stage supervised learning model from Fast.ai using collaborative filtering and an unsupervised learning model on Scikit-learn with K-means clustering.  
\- Developed an algorithm that lets the user escape the recommendation feedback loop while maintaining a high predictive user rating.

<!-- **Hotel Database Designer \| McGill** \| 2018  
\- Worked in teams to analyze and understand business and user requirements to create a detailed database design model of a hotel.  
\- Wrote complex queries and functions using SQL and Java languages for applications to interact with the database. -->

**Web Designer \| Centre Saint-Antoine 50+, Montreal, QC** \| 2017 [<i class="fa-solid fa-link"></i>](http://centrestantoine50plus.org/)  
\- Created a responsive mobile redesign of the website using jQuery, Bootstrap, and AngularJS and Improved the accessibility and ease of use for elderly clients.

**Software Engineer Intern \| Microsoft, Beijing** \| 2015  
\- Maintaining web components and websites for new and existing user clients using HTML, CSS, jQuery, Bootstrap, and AngularJS.  
\- Prototyped “MicroFriends” a social networking app for interns on android/iOS during the Microsoft Hackathon.
